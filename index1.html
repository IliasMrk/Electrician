    <p>Life isn't as easy as people nowadays think, especially in London. 
 Have a walk in the center of London and you will realise. 
 Everything goes really quick when you live here. 
 Time passes and you don't understand the rhythm that everything happens.
 It's the only city that eats its children. It shows what the expression <b>time is money </b>means.
